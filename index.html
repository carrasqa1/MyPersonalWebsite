    <h1>Hello,</h1>
    <p>My name is Ariana Mari Carrasquillo, but most people call me Chachi.
       I am a Sophomore pursuing a Computer Science degree at SUNY New Paltz. I have taken courses 
       such as Computer Science 1, PreCalc and Calc1. I am currently taking Computer Science 2: Data Structures
       and Calc2 along with some other General Education courses.</p>
    <p>Some of my interests include softball, swimming and photography. I like to capture life. 
        The movement, vibrance and beauty of life facinate me. I like to photograph the people 
        around me as well as the scenery. I have included a gallery page just to showcase some 
        of my favorite images. </p>
